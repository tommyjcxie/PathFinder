# ShortestPath
Data Structures and Algorithms assignment that calculates the shortest path from starting node to target node. A doubly-linked list was the data structure used for this project.
DLNode.Java, DLList.Java, and ShortestPath.Java were implemented by myself, the rest were given class files.
